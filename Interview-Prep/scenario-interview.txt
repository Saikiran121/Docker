01. A Docker container starts and exits immediately. How would you debug this?

02. You're getting a "port already in use" error when starting a container. What would you check?

03. A deployed container fails to reflect the latest code changes. What could be wrong?

04. You need to debug an issue inside a running container. What steps would you take?

05. Two containers on the same network can't communicate. How would you diagnose the issue?

06. You're trying to mount a volume, but data is not persisting. What might be causing this?

07. Container logs are not helpful for debugging. What alternate strategies would you use?

08. You notice containers are consuming excessive memory. How do you investigate and fix it?

09. Your Docker build is taking too long. How do you speed it up?

10. A container that works locally fails on staging. What differences would you look for?
